# thijsapp

This is a silly website that displays the next birthday of a Thijs, stored in a small database file offsite. The idea came from a whatsapp group.

The webserver runs on Flask and the single html page is styled using Bootstrap.

I run it as a docker container and it requirs two aditional arguments, for the location of the database file, and the port to host the webserver on.
